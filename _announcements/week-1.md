On Thursday, [Ludwig and Mitchell](https://mlfoundations.github.io/au21/staff/) will hold office hours from 12:30-1:30pm \[room TBA\], mainly for answering questions about the course project.

In addition, we invite students who are interested in auditing the course. Please visit [this link](https://registrar.washington.edu/registration/policies-procedures/) for more information on auditing and the corresponding steps.
