## About

In this course, we will examine the foundations of machine learning from an empirical perspective. We will start with fundamentals from applied statistics, learning theory, causality, and philosophy of science to build a rigorous toolkit for analyzing machine learning experiments. We will then see these concepts in action when we discuss key empirical advances from the past decade of machine learning research. The course will place a particular focus on the role of datasets, evaluations, and generalization / robustness. Finally we will proceed to the research frontier in these directions and discuss recent papers, the current state of the field, and possible future developments.

Why focus on empirical foundations? Many advances from the past decade of machine learning research are empirical in nature. Researchers propose a new method, evaluate it on a dataset, and claim success if the method improves over prior baselines. While the resulting methods sometimes appear ad-hoc and without principled motivation, this approach to machine learning research has led to some of the most widely used tools in computer science (pre-trained ResNets, Transformers, etc.). At the same time, the existing evaluation paradigm is coming under increasing pressure from the rapid growth of machine learning and the heightened expectations users have for the resulting methods. Indeed, there is now a growing literature on reliability concerns and failed evaluations in machine learning. This course will prepare students to engage with this literature and conduct rigorous experiments in machine learning.

The class format will be a combination of lectures and discussions. Students will be expected to participate in discussions and conduct a quarter-long research project.
